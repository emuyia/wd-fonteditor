White Day Font Editor is a .NET desktop application for editing proprietary bitmap font files (FNT and WFT) for White Day, a Korean PC horror game made in 2001. The application provides a UI for managing these files; exporting individual characters to bitmap, and then importing edits back in.

## Features

1. **Load Font Files:** Load White Day font files (WFT, FNT) as bytes and render the characters inside

2. **Export to BMP:** Export individual characters to bitmap files

3. **Import from BMP:** Import the bitmap files back into the loaded font instance

4. **Save Font Files:** Export the font instance as a new, edited White Day font (WFT, FNT)
